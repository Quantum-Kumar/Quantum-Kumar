ðŸš€ Quantum Physicist | Researcher | Simulation Enthusiast
Hi, Iâ€™m Rajkumar Singharia â€“ a physicist with a strong foundation in quantum optics, quantum sensing, and computational modeling. I work with tools like Python, QuTiP, Qiskit, and MATLAB to explore topics ranging from spin-squeezed protocols and decoherence to cavity QED and quantum control.

ðŸ§  Currently: Expanding my research in quantum-enhanced metrology and open quantum systems, with interest in applying theory to experimental platforms and real-world quantum technologies.

ðŸ”¬ Areas of interest:

Quantum metrology & sensing

Spin systems & squeezing

Quantum networks & control

Cavity-feedback models

Scientific computing & data analysis

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m always open to collaboration, learning, and contributing to meaningful quantum research.
